# Repository Guidelines

<!-- SDKWORK-AGENTS-GENERATED: v2 -->

## SDKWORK Soul

Read `../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md` before executing tasks in this root. Follow specs before memory, dictionary before context, stop on ambiguity, and evidence before completion.

## SDKWORK Standards

Canonical SDKWORK specs path from this root:

- `../sdkwork-specs/README.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/AGENTS_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/PNPM_SCRIPT_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md`
- `../sdkwork-specs/SOURCE_CONFIG_SPEC.md`

Do not copy root standard text into this repository. If these relative paths do not resolve, stop and report the broken workspace layout.

## Documentation Canon

- [Memory product PRD](docs/product/prd/PRD.md)
- [Memory technical architecture](docs/architecture/tech/TECH_ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Application Identity

Read `sdkwork.app.config.json` only when the task touches Memory application behavior, runtime config, SDK wiring, release metadata, app-owned capabilities, packaging, or deployment. For unrelated documentation or tooling work, do not expand into the full app manifest unless evidence requires it.

## Local Dictionary Structure

- `AGENTS.md`: repository agent entrypoint and relative SDKWork spec index.
- `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `CODEX.md`: compatibility shims that point to `AGENTS.md` and must not duplicate rules.
- `sdkwork.app.config.json`: Memory application identity, runtime, release, and capability metadata.
- `sdkwork.workflow.json`: GitHub packaging/release workflow manifest governed by `GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`.
- `.github/workflows/package.yml`: thin reusable workflow call only.
- `.sdkwork/`: repository/application AI workspace metadata, local skills, local plugins, and manifests.
- `specs/`: local application/component contracts and narrowing rules.
- `apis/`: Memory-owned API contract sources and materialized OpenAPI inputs.
- `apps/`: independently governed client application roots, including the Memory PC Console and Admin application.
- `crates/`: reusable Rust service, repository, route, and API server crates.
- `sdks/`: SDK families, SDK generation manifests, route manifests, and generated SDK artifacts.
- `database/`: database contract, baseline DDL, migrations, seeds, and drift policy.
- `etc/`, `deployments/`, `scripts/`, `tools/`, `docs/`, `tests/`: source-owned config templates, deployment descriptors, thin command entrypoints, validators, documentation, and verification assets.
- `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`: language/build manifests.

## Spec Resolution Order

Use dynamic progressive loading:

1. Read this `AGENTS.md` and any nearer component-level `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read `sdkwork.app.config.json` only when app behavior, runtime config, SDK wiring, release, packaging, or app-owned capabilities are touched.
3. Read local `specs/README.md` and `specs/component.spec.json` only when the task touches that local contract.
4. Read local `.sdkwork/README.md`, `.sdkwork/skills/`, and `.sdkwork/plugins/` only when local agent extensions are relevant.
5. Read `../sdkwork-specs/README.md`, then only the task-specific root specs.
6. Inspect implementation files after the dictionary and relevant specs are clear.

Do not load the whole repository or every root spec before identifying the task surface.

## Required Specs By Task Type

- Agent/workflow changes: `../sdkwork-specs/SOUL.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/AGENTS_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/SDKWORK_WORKSPACE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`, and `../sdkwork-specs/TEST_SPEC.md`.
- Package script changes: `../sdkwork-specs/PNPM_SCRIPT_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/APP_RUNTIME_TOPOLOGY_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/CONFIG_SPEC.md`, and `../sdkwork-specs/TEST_SPEC.md`.
- Any code change: `../sdkwork-specs/CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md`, plus only the touched language/framework spec.
- Rust code: `../sdkwork-specs/RUST_CODE_SPEC.md`; add `../sdkwork-specs/RUST_RPC_SPEC.md` when RPC is touched.
- API/SDK changes: `../sdkwork-specs/API_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/WEB_FRAMEWORK_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/WEB_BACKEND_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/SDK_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/SDK_WORKSPACE_GENERATION_SPEC.md`, and `../sdkwork-specs/TEST_SPEC.md`.
- Database changes: `../sdkwork-specs/DATABASE_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/DATABASE_FRAMEWORK_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/PRIVACY_SPEC.md`, and `../sdkwork-specs/TEST_SPEC.md`.
- Runtime/deployment/release changes: `../sdkwork-specs/SOURCE_CONFIG_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/CONFIG_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/ENVIRONMENT_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/DEPLOYMENT_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/RELEASE_SPEC.md`, and `../sdkwork-specs/GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`.
- Provider/integration changes: `../sdkwork-specs/INTEGRATION_SPEC.md`, `../sdkwork-specs/SECURITY_SPEC.md`, and `../sdkwork-specs/PRIVACY_SPEC.md`.

Language-specific specs are on-demand; do not load Rust, Java, TypeScript, and frontend specs for unrelated tasks.

## Code Style Rules

Read `../sdkwork-specs/CODE_STYLE_SPEC.md` and `../sdkwork-specs/NAMING_SPEC.md` before code changes. Generated SDK output under `generated/server-openapi` must not be hand-edited. Fix OpenAPI, route manifests, generator input, or approved composed facades, then regenerate. Use `sdkwork-utils-rust` and `sdkwork-id-core` for shared helpers instead of duplicating utility logic locally.

## Build, Test, and Verification

Use canonical root package scripts from `PNPM_SCRIPT_SPEC.md`:

```powershell
pnpm verify
pnpm check
pnpm topology:validate
pnpm db:validate
```

## Agent Execution Rules

Do not rely on memory when a relevant SDKWork spec exists. Do not replace generated SDK calls with raw HTTP. Stop when the relative specs path, app identity, component spec, API authority, SDK family, table prefix, or provider ownership is ambiguous.

## Task-Specific Standards

API work loads `../sdkwork-specs/API_SPEC.md` and its validators. List/search work loads `../sdkwork-specs/PAGINATION_SPEC.md` and `check-pagination.mjs`. SDK consumer work loads `../sdkwork-specs/APP_SDK_INTEGRATION_SPEC.md` and `../sdkwork-specs/SDK_SPEC.md` for the touched surface. Source configuration work loads `../sdkwork-specs/SOURCE_CONFIG_SPEC.md` and `check-source-config-standard.mjs`. Link these authorities instead of copying their normative bodies into `AGENTS.md`.

## Human Review Rules

Human review is required for breaking public API changes, schema migrations, privacy/security exceptions, generated SDK ownership changes, provider lock-in decisions, and destructive filesystem or data operations.

<!-- SDKWORK-MAIN-BRANCH-STANDARD: v1 -->
## Main-Branch Development

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/REPOSITORY_BASELINE_SPEC.md` section 1.

Development happens on `main`. Everything authored in this repository is committed onto `main`.

- A working tree that receives authored content MUST have `main` checked out as its current branch
  for the whole time that work is in progress. Commit onto `main` directly; do not commit onto a
  branch a later merge is expected to bring in.
- A detached HEAD MUST NOT be used as a development venue. A commit created while HEAD is detached
  from every branch is reachable only through the reflog — absent from every branch history, from a
  fresh `git clone` of this repository, and from every other working tree — so the work it carries
  is one `git gc` away from being unrecoverable. Do not check out a bare commit, a tag, or an older
  ref in order to "get a clean starting point" and commit there.
- A side branch MUST NOT be used as a development venue either. There is no long-lived feature,
  release, maintenance, or personal branch, and this repository MUST NOT accumulate local commits
  that `main` cannot reach: making them findable would then depend on a merge that may never happen.
- A checkout off `main` is legitimate only while it stays read-only — a dependency or SDK pinned to
  an explicit commit, a release artifact checkout, or a bisect. No authored change is committed there.
- A working tree found detached, or on a branch other than `main`, with work in it is a STOP, not a
  cleanup. Do not move refs, do not rewrite history, and do not discard the commits. Report the
  branch, the commits, and the state, and let a human decide: moving commits onto `main` and
  discarding work are both governed by `../sdkwork-specs/DESTRUCTIVE_OPERATION_SPEC.md` and
  `../sdkwork-specs/ROLLBACK_RESTRICTION_SPEC.md`.

Verification (from the repository root):

```bash
node ../sdkwork-specs/tools/audit-repository-baseline.mjs --root . --only branch-main
node ../sdkwork-specs/tools/sync-agent-main-branch-standard.mjs --root . --check
```

The first fails when the current branch is anything other than `main`, and reports a detached HEAD
as `detached`. The second fails when this block is out of date.

## pnpm Workspace Dependency And Package Import

Authority: `../sdkwork-specs/PNPM_WORKSPACE_DEPENDENCY_SPEC.md` (companion to
`../sdkwork-specs/DEPENDENCY_MANAGEMENT_SPEC.md`).

Sibling SDKWork repositories are consumed through a dual-track model that MUST stay consistent:

- **Local development** (`pnpm dev`, `pnpm build`): pnpm workspace protocol. Each sibling
  package is declared ONCE in this repository root `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `packages:` as a
  `../sdkwork-*` relative path, and consumed with `workspace:*` in `package.json`. Never use
  `file:`/`link:`/git-URL specifiers for SDKWork sibling packages in any environment.
- **CI / release packaging**: git-repository dependency checkout. Every sibling referenced by the
  local workspace MUST have a matching `dependencies[]` entry in `sdkwork.workflow.json` so CI
  clones the sibling into the same `../sdkwork-*` relative layout (`GITHUB_WORKFLOW_SPEC.md`).
  `package.json` is never rewritten for CI.

Import rules for sibling SDKWork packages:

- Import by package name only: `import { X } from "@sdkwork/package-name"`. The specifier MUST
  equal the target package's `package.json` `name` exactly - no shortening, renaming, or alias.
- Forbidden: relative imports that cross a package boundary into another SDKWork repository or
  another workspace package's `src/` (for example `import ... from "../../sdkwork-appbase/.../src/..."`).
- Consume only the public `exports` surface of a package; never deep-import sibling `src/` internals.
- Every non-relative import in a workspace member MUST resolve to that member's own
  `dependencies`/`devDependencies`/`peerDependencies` (import closure).
- Vite aliases MUST NOT rename or redirect `@sdkwork/*` packages, MUST NOT be added to make a
  resolution error pass, and are allowed only for documented bootstrap/SDK-generation entrypoints.
- Fix a resolution failure by correcting the workspace declaration or the package `exports`,
  not by adding an alias.

Verification:

```bash
node ../sdkwork-specs/tools/verify-repo.mjs --root .
node ../sdkwork-specs/tools/check-workspace-member-protocol.mjs --root .
node ../sdkwork-specs/tools/check-dependency-list-completeness.mjs --root .
```
